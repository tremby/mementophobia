Current state
-------------

Usable. Horribly messy code.

The available information on ghost speeds and abilities is in places rough,
contradictory, ambiguous, etc.
As such, some assumptions have been made,
based on observations and common sense.
They may not all be correct.

Future plans
------------

Mainly tidying it both on the surface and underneath,
adding a couple of missing features,
and adding tests so I don't accidentally break it.

Contributions
-------------

Bug reports, feature requests, pull requests, etc are welcome.
