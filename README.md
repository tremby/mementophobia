Current state
-------------

Usable. Horribly messy code.

The available information on ghost speeds and abilities is in places rough,
contradictory, ambiguous, etc.
The moderators on the Discord server don't seem to much care,
so it's hard to get definitive answers.
As such, some assumptions have been made,
based on observations and common sense.
They may not all be correct.
There are some notes about them in the comments in the source code.

Future plans
------------

Mainly tidying it both on the surface and underneath,
adding a couple of missing features,
and adding tests so I don't accidentally break it.

I don't want to add a switch for every single possible scrap of secondary evidence,
since some of them are so rare and niche
that the kind of player who notices it will already know what to do with it.

Contributions
-------------

Bug reports, feature requests, pull requests, etc are welcome.
